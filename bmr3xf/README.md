*In this activity you will explore the populations of seals overtime.*

## Overview of data
I used data from https://datadryad.org/bitstream/handle/10255/dryad.178573/GIS_species_data.zip which describes the population density of seals over time.

## Q1: How do seal populations over time compare in each zone?

*Interpreation*: In this data we can see three different zones: Barrents Sea, Franz Josef Land, and the Kara Sea. Because each zone is indicated by a color, you can visually see that the Kara Sea represents a large portion of the seal populations counted. Second to Kara Sea is the Barrents Sea. The zone with the smallest seal population is Franz Josef Land. 

## Q2: Are seal populations increasing or decreasing over time?

*Interpreation*: The data shows that seal populations seem to fluctutate over time. The 'Number of Seals' indicates the average number of seals counted in one day. In 1998, scientists were able to daily count 2.5 seals on average. In 2002 this average rises to almost 5 seals per day. In between the spikes of number of seals in 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2005, there are declines in seal counts. In 2003 the average daily count for seals was 1.

## Q3: When do seal populations increase throughout the year?

*Interpreation*: The data show that each year on average has a spike in seal counts in the third month. This means that in March you are more likely to see seals in these zones. Populations are at their lowest at the beginnig of the year.
